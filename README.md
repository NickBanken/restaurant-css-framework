##### NOTE:
First of all, I don't spreak french, so my excuses if the translation is incorrect.
Secondly this is a remake of an old assignment we had at BeCode.

#### GOAL:
Make a website for Pizza Mane, A pizza delivery restaurant that wants to reach out to people.
Objective is to make it user friendly and useable for anyone.

1. The customer can look where the restaurents are layed out
2. Can order for delivery.
3. See the whole menu and options online.
4. Select the prefered language.
5. Sign up for newsletter

Once again, this is WIP.

Cheers!
